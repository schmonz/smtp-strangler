## Feature ideas

- Add `CONF` verb that returns `250 https://www.spaconference.org/spa2018/`
- Append `GDPR 20160414` to `EHLO` output
- Make `BRXT` a synonym for `QUIT`
- Reject mail from Tim


## Ideas that might be too big

- Log `MAIL FROM` and `RCPT TO` parameters, with a timestamp
- Also log whether the server accepted or rejected
- Log to SQLite instead
